# QRNN vs RNN in the presence of noise
# code for the QRNN is in the qrnn.py file
# code for visualizing the noise is in the data_analysis.ipynb file

# to run the QRNN, there is a conda environment with all the required modules
# the code for the QRNN and RNN models is sourced from https://github.com/nsu-ai/quantum-CV-RNN
